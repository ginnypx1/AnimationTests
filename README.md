# Test Animations

Test Animations is a simple project that allows you to see all kinds of basic UIView animations (as well as a couple of UIImageView and UIButton methods), in code and running in the simulator, and play around with them in a test environment.

The animations are as outlined in Matt Neuberg's "Programming iOS 10: Deep Dive inot Views, View Controllers, and Frameworks"
